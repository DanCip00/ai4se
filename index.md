# AI for Software Engineering

The emergence of advanced AI-driven tools has led to a wide range of opportunities and transformations in software engineering practices and education. Recognizing this potential, [JetBrains] and [Delft University of Technology][tudelft] have collaborated to establish the **AI for Software Engineering (AI4SE)** research partnership. Together, we are committed to conducting cutting-edge research on the impact and utilization of AI methodologies in software engineering. Our areas of focus include diverse facets of the domain, such as software development, testing, and programming education.

AI4SE was launched in 2023, and participates in the Innovation Center for Artificial Intelligence ([ICAI]) as one of its labs.
