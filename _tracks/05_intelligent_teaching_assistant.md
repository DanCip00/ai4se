This track aims to develop an intelligent, AI-based student assistant that provides context-informed support for programming education while stimulating knowledge transfer. We will focus specifically on how automatically generated hints can guide students toward the right solution, how students interact with the intelligent assistant, and how efficient their interactions are toward their learning objectives.
