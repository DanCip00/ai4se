This track aims to refine generic large language models for code to suit various scenarios. By tailoring these models to the specific needs of individual users, projects, and organizations, we can ensure personalized outputs. The models will be optimized to produce legal, safe, and timely predictions and operate efficiently on low-resource devices.
